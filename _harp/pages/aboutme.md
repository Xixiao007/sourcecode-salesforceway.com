- My first name is Xi, which pronouces like the word "she" in English. I am originally from China, and have lived in Finland for 10+ years.
- I work as a Salesforce developer since Feb. 2018. My previous working positions did not require me to code, but I do code in my spare time.
- I enjoy sharing, learning from others, listening to life stories. This is one of reasons that I intiated the Salesforce Way podcast.
